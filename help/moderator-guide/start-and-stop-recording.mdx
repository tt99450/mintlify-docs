## When a BigBlueButton conference/activity is enabled for recording, the Moderator can engage the Start/Stop button in the live session to generate a recording.

It is important to note that enabling your conference/activity to be recorded when it was created is **not** an auto capture function. A Moderator **must** still engage the start/stop record in the live session for a recording to process.

The Recording icon is located in the top centre of the BigBlueButton interface to the right of the session title.

## To start the recording select the **Start Recording** button:

When started, the recording icon will change to red and a timer will begin counting up the total number of recorded minutes captured.

## To stop or pause the recording select the **red icon and timer**:

### It is important to note that the recording processing takes approximately the same amount of time as the **full** duration of the live session and does not begin until the session has ended or all attendees have logged out of the BigBlueButton.

### Note: All sessions have a duration of 9 hours.
