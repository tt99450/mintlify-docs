The [multi-user whiteboard](/help/releases/how-do-i-use-the-multi-user-whiteboard) is a popular feature in BigBlueButton.  Now, in BigBlueButton 2.3, we have added the Per-User Whiteboard to help with user engagement and allow instructors to choose an individual user to mark up the presentation.

To enable the Per-User Whiteboard, **select a user [1]** and then select **Give whiteboard access [2]**.

Once you have given an individual user whiteboard access, a pen icon appears next to their avatar.

The user now has all the capabilities outlined in the [multi-user whiteboard](/help/releases/how-do-i-use-the-multi-user-whiteboard) article.

When granting individual whiteboard access, a count will appear on the multi-user whiteboard icon showing you how many students you have granted access to the whiteboard.

How do I remove Whiteboard access once it has been granted?

There are two ways to remove Whiteboard access.

Clicking the **multi-user whiteboard icon [1]** removes whiteboard access from everyone except the presenter.

You can also remove individual users' access by clicking their **user name [1]** from the list of users and then clicking **Remove whiteboard access [2]**.
