## Automatic captions in Chrome

The BigBlueButton client can now automatically create captions when using Chrome.  

This feature can be enabled for your account (contact us to enable). When enabled, each will have the option of enabling captions for their voice.  Typically, in a class, you want the educator to enable captions for their audio.

As soon as one user has enabled captions, all users will see a CC button at the bottom

When a user selects the CC button, they will see captions for all speakers that have enabled captions when joining audio.

The users can view the transcript by clicking Live Transcript on the left-hand (shown above) side to see a panel that displays a transcript of the meeting.

After the meeting is over, the captions will also automatically appear as sub-titles in the recordings.

Note about privacy - Google implements the standard browser speech-to-text APIs by sending the user's audio to their Cloud services for live transcription.  It works very well, but the user's audio is shared with Google for doing the STT.  

We want you to be aware of this sharing of personal data before we enable this feature on your account.
