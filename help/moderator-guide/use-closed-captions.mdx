## **If you are using the Chrome browser, you can set it to Auto Caption**

You can set the Chrome browser to auto caption. Here is a [link to a blog](https://blog.google/products/chrome/live-caption-chrome/#:~:text=To%20turn%20on%20Live%20Caption,be%20coming%20soon%20to%20ChromeOS.) written by Google that discusses it and shows you how to set it.

## If you have a user who can create Live Closed Captions, they are accessible to users with the assigned role of Moderator.

As a moderator you can access the Live Closed Captioning feature in a live meeting, enabling students with audio accessibility barriers the opportunity to actively participate in their BigBlueButton sessions. 

***It is important to note that this is not an auto capture function and requires manual input. We recommend assigning a third party (second moderator) to act as a stenographer in the live session.***

Live Closed Captions are also processed into the recoding playback for later viewing.

## Closed Captions

The closed captioning function is located in the moderator menu in the users list of the BigBlueButton interface.

\*If you do not have access to this menu you have not been assigned the moderator role.\*
