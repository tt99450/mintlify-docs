## As a moderator you have the ability to restrict or "Lock" viewer's ability to access media and other components of the BigBlueButton interface.

In some cases you may want to restrict the viewers from accessing features or media within the BigBlueButton interface. Some common examples include:

- Restricting access to the public chat to encourage attendees to use their microphones/verbalize.
- Locking the private chat to reduce back channel communications, such as online testing.
- Restricting viewer's ability to share their webcams; reduces bandwidth and focuses viewer attention on uploaded content.
- Locking the shared notes to reduce back channel communications or to use as moderator notes (only moderators would be able to access)

### **It is important to note that the following lock settings do not apply to other moderators in the session.**

## Applying the lock settings

The available lock settings include:

- **Share webcam [1]**: restricts viewer's ability to share their webcams.
- **See other viewer's webcams [2]**: when enabled, only the moderator's incoming webcam will be visible to viewers, while all viewers' webcams are still visible to the moderator - this setting also reduces the bandwidth for individual viewers.
- **Share microphone [3]**: restricts a viewer's ability to share their mic. If there are already mics joined in the session when this lock setting is applied, all joined mics will be automatically muted and locked restricting a viewer's ability to unmute.
- **Send Public chat messages [4]**: restricts viewer's ability to post to the public chat.
- **Send Private chat messages [5]**: restricts viewer's ability to send private chat messages to other viewers unless a moderator sends a private chat. Viewers can reply to private chat messages from moderators when the private chat is locked.
- **Edit Shared Notes [6]:** restricts viewer's ability to open and contribute to the shared notes.
- **See other viewers in the Users List [7]:** restricts viewer's ability to see other attendees/number of attendees in the users list. When enabled, viewers will only see their own users icon and the moderator.
- **See other viewers cursors [8]:** restricts viewer's ability to see their own and other attendees cursors on the whiteboard. When enabled, viewers will only see the moderator's cursor.
- **See other viewers annotations [9]:** restricts viewer's ability to see their own and other attendees annotations on the whiteboard. When enabled, viewers will only see the moderator's annotations.
