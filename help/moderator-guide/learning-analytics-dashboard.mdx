What Is BigBlueButton’s Learning Analytics Dashboard?

While accessing and applying BigBlueButton’s features during lessons is easy, recalling, evaluating and addressing student participation and engagement is more complicated. Why is this assessment critical? In digital learning, as with traditional physical classroom learning, raising learner attainment is a crucial goal.

Learning outcome reports indicate that real-time assessment substantially increases attainment. In-lesson real-time assessments could include end-of-class surveys, polls, and anonymous quizzes, all proven to enhance learner outcomes and attainment.

## Why A Live Learning Analytics Dashboard?

A live Learning Analytics Dashboard offers real-time monitoring, visualization and capture of in-classroom, synchronous learning activities to inform educators, add valuable insight, and facilitate vital learner goal setting, and progress tracking.

Having real-time access to learner status, outcomes, and statistics during class can speed up educator intervention times, the ability to use this valuable data to support learners through more meaningful parent engagement, and administrator access to more accurate performance assessment. Hence, access to an in-lesson summary overview of learner status and progress is increasingly essential.

## Why Our Learning Analytics Dashboard?

We call this innovative new analytics feature your ‘educator’s co-pilot’ for a good reason. Validate your intuitive choices while ensuring efficient data-driven engagement decisions with valid, reliable and accurate classroom information. Stay on top of who’s in attendance, engaged and learning via real-time classroom session user metrics, including:

- **When did each learner join the session?**
- **How long have they been in attendance, and are they still online?**
- **Who is directly engaged and talking, and for how long?**
- **Who is sharing their webcam, and for how long?**
- **Who is messaging, responding with emojis and hand raising?**
- **What are the learner poll responses?**

Moderators can use this detailed overview feature to monitor who is absent, who may need encouragement or draw out, and who could benefit from additional attention and content mentoring. Then, immediately address any engagement or understanding concerns through our constantly updating live dashboard.

Once you’ve logged into your LMS as a moderator, you can access the Learning Analytics Dashboard by selecting it under the tools (gear) icon. Our user-friendly navigation allows you to switch between views, facilitating fast performance gauging and appropriate and effective action.
