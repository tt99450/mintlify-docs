## Moderators in BigBlueButton have the ability to end the current meeting on logout for all users.

All users have the ability to log out of the BigBlueButton, however, only the moderator can end the meeting on logout for those connected.

By ending the meeting on log out you ensure the meeting is not kept open or active by any users who do not log out (for whatever reason).

Ending the meeting on log out also sends any recorded segments for processing immediately.

## To end the meeting on log out
