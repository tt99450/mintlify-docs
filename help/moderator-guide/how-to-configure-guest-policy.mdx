**Always deny** - every user attempting to join will be automatically denied entry

**Always accept** - every user attempting to join will be automatically allowed entry

**Ask moderator** - as users attempt to join, their request is queued in the lobby.  Moderators can view pending requests and allow or deny users individually.  Moderators can also allow users waiting in the lobby all at once, or deny them all at once.  If Moderators wish to send a message to users waiting in the lobby, they can do so individually, or to everyone all at once.
