BigBlueButton automatically extracts poll questions (and video links) from your uploaded sides, giving you a single button to start a poll.

We call it “Smart Slides”.

When you have a slide deck with poll-type questions, you'll see a button to automatically start a poll.

Download it, upload to BigBlueButton, and look for the Smart Slides button when BigBlueButton has detected a poll question.
