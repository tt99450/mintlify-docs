![Screen_Shot_2019-02-11_at_12.44.21_PM.png](/images/360020972972.png)

Next you will enter into a private echo test. This echo test will let you quickly check that your microphone is working.

After you see the Echo Test dialog, speak a few words into your microphone.  You should hear an echo of your words and this is how you will sound to others in the session.  If you hear yourself, select **Yes** **[2]**.

A pop up message will appear to indicate that you are sharing your audio.

Try selecting a different **Microphone** **[1]** and **Speaker [2]** from the available devices in the drop down lists.

Use **Play Sound [3]** to test the speakers.

Once finished, select **Retry [4]** to re-enter the echo test again to confirm your microphone is now transmitting.   If you don't hear yourself in the echo test, see the Troubleshooting section below.

After joining audio with microphone, you will see a microphone icon next to your name.

If you do not want to join the audio at all, select the ‘x’ in the upper right-hand corner of the Audio Chooser dialog.

## Troubleshooting Microphone

On Windows or Mac OS X, if you are still unable to hear yourself in the echo test, visit our test server at

https://demo.bigbluebutton.org/

and join the audio with microphone and go through the steps below.  These steps below are for the Chrome browser.

1. Refresh the client (select the refresh button in your browser -- you don’t need to login again, the client will automatically reload).
2. Verify you have a working microphone.

**On Windows 10**, right-click on the audio icon in the task bar and choose **Open Sound Settings**.

![mceclip1.png](/images/360067003012.png)

Windows will open a Settings window showing you the settings for your current input audio devices.

![mceclip0.png](/images/360067214011.png)

Talk into your microphone and you should see the energy bar highlight under **Test your microphone** as you speak.  If there is no energy, try choosing a different microphone under **Choose your audio device**.

Once you see energy in the microphone, close the Settings window, and leave and rejoin (or refresh) your session in BigBlueButton.  When prompted to join the audio, choose Microphone and listen to ensure you hear yourself in the echo test.

On **Mac OS X**open System Preferences and type in sound.  Choose **Sound input**.

![mceclip3.png](/images/360067003132.png)

As you talk, you need to see blue bars highlight on the **Input Level**. Tap your microphone — you should use see the blue energy bars move. If not, select a different microphone from the list.

![mceclip4.png](/images/360067214071.png)

Once you see energy in the microphone, close the Settings window, and leave and rejoin (or refresh) your session in BigBlueButton.  When prompted to join the audio, choose Microphone and you should now hear yourself in the echo test.  If not, verify on Mac OS X that [Chrome has permission to access the microphone](/help/troubleshooting/mac-os-updates-bigbluebutton-media-permissions).

_This feature will be available with the upcoming BigBlueButton 3.0 update._

When you join the BigBlueButton session, you will see a prompt showing several audio settings. You can select your microphone input **[1]**, speaker output **[2]**, test your audio feedback **[3]**, and join audio when you are done adjusting your settings **[4]**
