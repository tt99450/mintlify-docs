You can adjust the ratio of webcams to presentation area (which may also be showing a screen sharing).

To adjust, hover your cursor over the top of the presentation area/under the webcam(s) displayed until a resize icon appears.

Drag the cursor down to enlarge the webcam(s)/reduce the presentation area.

This change is local to your client -- it does not change how other viewers are watching the webcam.
