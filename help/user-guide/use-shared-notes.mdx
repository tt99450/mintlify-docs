## In addition to public and private chats, all users in BigBlueButton can access the Shared Notes panel.

Shared notes enable all the users in a meeting to contribute to a common text based file; you can use formatting options and always export the shared notes later.

When in use or when new edits have been made, the shared notes icon will show a new edit alert to the users to indicate the shared notes are in use.

## It is important to note the following:

- Shared Notes are not captured in the recording processing.
- All users must open their Shared Notes pad individually.
- Shared Notes contributions are anonymous.
