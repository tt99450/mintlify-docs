Enable **Audio alerts [4]**, and **Popup alerts [5]** to notify you of new incoming chat messages while in the BigBlueButton meeting and when your chat pane or users list is minimized.

**It is important to note that all alerts are in-browser only and do not behave like desktop push notifications.**

Select **Save **to apply any changes made or **Close** to return to the meeting.

### Data Savings
