### Old:

While BigBlueButton does not have the built-in ability to provide a virtual background yet, there are free 3rd party tools that you can install (Mac OS X and PC) that will give you a virtual background.

We recommend using [ChromaCam](https://www.chromacam.me/) (click link for steps to install).  After you have it installed, when you click the Share webcam button

select **ChromeaCam** from the Camera drop down menu.

**NOTE**

When using the ChromaCam software, you can preview what your background will look like.  Once you have selected your background you must either close the software or make sure the Preview toggle is set to off

If not, you will get an error in BigBlueButton like this: <img src="/images/mceclip3_1.png" alt="mceclip3.png" />

and, again, either

- close the CromaCam dialog, or
- set the Preview toggle to OFF.
