The Raise Hand feature makes it much easier for students to interact with their instructor.

To raise a hand, any user can select the hand icon.

A prompt will also appear in the top-right corner, showing that your hand is raised.

There will also be a prompt when you lower your hand, and the emoji will be removed from your user icon.
