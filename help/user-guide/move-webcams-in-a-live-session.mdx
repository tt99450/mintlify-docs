## When webcams are shared in a live session, a user can drag the webcam(s) to a preferred area of the BigBlueButton interface.

By default, webcams will display to the bottom or top middle of the BigBlueButton interface.

The following YouTube video provides an overview of how a user can move the webcams around in the BigBlueButton client:

As noted, users can "drag and drop" a single webcam anywhere on their screen or "snap" the webcam(s) to the top or bottom portion of the Presentation area.

**It is important to note that moving the webcams only affects the local view of individual users and cannot be pushed out by a moderator at this time.**
