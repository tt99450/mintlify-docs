## Welcome to Personal Rooms! A simple front-end for using BigBlueButton outside your institution's Learning Management System (LMS).

This article contains the following sections:

## What is Personal Rooms?

Personal Rooms is a simple front-end that allows your instructors to access BigBlueButton outside of your institution's Learning Management System (LMS).

Please note Personal Rooms use counts towards your premium purchased capacity.  Ie.  If an instructor has a Personal Room active and another instructor is using BigBlueButton in your LMS at the same time, that is 2 concurrent sessions.

Personal Rooms has all the features required to make your BigBlueButton server manageable and accessible, such as:

- Signup/Login with Office 365 or Google.
- Manage your account settings and user preferences.
- Create and manage your own personal rooms (BigBlueButton sessions).
- Allow users to wait for your room to start, then automatically join when it does.
- Invite others to your room using a simple URL.
- View recordings and share them with others.

You can try Personal Rooms on our [demo server.](https://demo.bigbluebutton.org/gl)

## What we need from you to setup Personal Rooms

In order to set up a Personal Room instance for you or your institution we would need to configure your account authorization method.

Personal Rooms supports the following types of authentication:

1. [Google OAuth2](/help/getting-started/google-oauth2)
2. [Office 365 OAuth2](/help/getting-started/office-365-oauth2)

If your institution uses one of the supported authentication methods, then select the supported method and submit a request to [support@blindsidenetworks.com](mailto:support@blindsidenetworks.com) with

1. The required authorization parameters (see details in above links), and
2. A person at your organization (name and e-mail) who we can setup as the administrator for your Personal Rooms.

## Requesting Personal Rooms

If you are not a hosted customer of Blindside Networks and would like to use the Personal Rooms front end, reach out to your account manager or send us an email at [team@blindsidentworks.com](mailto:team@blindsidentworks.com).
