## What is the Greenlight/In Application Authorization?

The Greenlight or In Application authorization method allows any user with your Personal Rooms URL to sign up and create an account regardless of the user's host domain.

## What we need from you..

To set up **In Application Authorization** we need to know some additional information regarding your registration preferences. There are three separate registration methods that can be applied:  
  
1. Open registration: allows any user to sign up and log into your Personal Rooms instance.  
  
2. Join By Invitation: disabled open sign up - only users who have received an invitation from an Administrator will be allowed to sign up. This method requires e-mail invitations.  
  
3. Approve/Decline: allows any user to sign up, but they must be approved by the Administrator in order to create an account and access the features available.
