## What is Office 365 OAuth2?

The Office 365 OAuth2 authentication method does not require the installation of a new app and allows users to authenticate using their Office 365 e-mail based on the host domain assigned to your account.

## What we need from you....

Your institution's **Host Domain**ex: blindsidenetworks.com

In other words, the domain of the email addresses hosted by Office 365.
