## A presenter in BigBlueButton has the ability to control and annotate content uploaded into the presentation area or the whiteboard.

The presenter role enables the user assigned the ability to:

1. [Control the slide navigation](#slide-navigation),
2. [Use the slide/whiteboard annotations](/help/moderator-guide/how-do-i-use-the-multi-user-whiteboard), and
3. [Enable the multiuser whiteboard](/help/moderator-guide/how-do-i-use-the-multi-user-whiteboard) for use by attendees.

By default, the first **Moderator** to enter the BigBlueButton session is allocated the presenter role capabilities; if you are a viewer, you will need to request presenter status from the moderator.

When a user has the presenter role, the **presenter icon**will appear over their avatar in the users list.

## Slide Navigation

Once you have uploaded content into the BigBlueButton presentation area, you have the ability to control the navigation and visual orientation of the content displayed.

The presenter's slide/content control panel is located under the presentation display and above your media control icons.

To navigate through your content, use the **Slide Navigator [1]**located in the presenter control panel; advance using the**forward ">"** navigation arrows, return using the **backwards "\<"**navigations arrows.

Skip to a specific slide by selecting the specific slide number from the **dropdown.**

**Zoom In (+) or Out (-) [2]**, use **Fit-to-Width [3]**, or engage **Full Screen Mode [4]**.

When upload a portrait document, use Fit-to-Width to make the text larger.  You can then click and drag with the hand tool to move up/down the document.
