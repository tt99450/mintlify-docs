## In order to upload documents and enable them for download you must first have the presenter role.

By default the first **Moderator** to enter the BigBlueButton session is allocated presenter role capabilities; if you are a viewer you will need to request presenter status from the moderator.

When a user has the presenter role, the **presenter icon**will appear over their avatar in the users list.

## Next be sure your documents are within the size restrictions and are an accepted format.

Maximum size is **30 MB or 150 pages** per document; you can upload multiple documents into the BigBlueButton as long as they are under the size restrictions.

BigBlueButton will accept Office documents ( **.doc .docx .pptx**), text documents **(.txt)**, images **(.png ,.jpg)** and**Adobe Acrobat documents (.pdf);**we recommend converting documents to **.pdf** prior to uploading for best results.

## To Upload

The BigBlueButton presentation uploader will appear. The uploader allows you to **drag and drop [3]** files into the uploader or **browse for files [4]** on your OS.

When uploading multiple files at once, be sure to set the file you'd like to be displayed by default, then check the **green circle**to the right of the document.

Once you have selected your chosen file(s) for upload, press **start** to convert and upload the files.

Depending on the size of your document it may take several moments for it to convert and finally upload to the meeting.

## Enabling for Download

Any presenter uploading a document can enable it for download by viewers of the live conference at any time.

To enable, select the **enable download icon** located to the right of the document.
