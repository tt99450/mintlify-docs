## Presenters in BigBlueButton are able to initiate polls and quizzing throughout the live session; users can reply when prompted and contribute to the poll.

# Polling

As a presenter you can use polling to engage students, perform test/exam reviews or pop quizzes, or use polling informally to collect information about your users.

By default, the first **Moderator** to enter the BigBlueButton session is allocated the presenter role capabilities; if you are a viewer you will need to request presenter status from the moderator.

When a user has the presenter role, the **presenter icon**will appear over their avatar in the users list.

## Starting a Poll

Select the **Actions menu [1]** in the lower left hand corner of the presentation window, then **Start a poll/quiz****[2]**.

The Poll option is selected by default.  The remainder of this section will discuss polls, and the next section will discus quizzes.

The panel will open with several options. You can also enter a question for the poll in the **Write your question [3]** section. Select from the **Response Types** **[4]** options to initiate a poll.

For example, if you write **"Did Einstein discover the atom?" [1]**, select **True / False [2]**, and select Start Poll [3], it will initiate the poll for all users.

When Start Poll is selected, BigBlueButton will poll all users.

As users respond, such as clicking False, the presenter will see the live results.

Here the the poll/quiz panel shows the **False [1]** result from the student. Note: Selecting **Anonymous Poll** will not show the student's name for each result.

Selecting **Publish results [2]** will both publish the results to the chat

and to the slide.

Published results appear in recordings both in the chat and slide as well.

## Quizzing

BigBlueButton now supports quizzing, which you can think of as polls with a correct answer.

To do a quiz, select **Quiz [1]** and the options now show response types with multiple choices.

After selecting a Quiz, you can enter a question, such as **"Did Einstein discover the atom?" [1]**, choose **True/False [2]**, select **False [3]** as the correct answer, and select **Start quiz [4]**.

After you select Start Quiz, users will see a prompt to respond to the quiz.

As before, the presenter will see the live results. Since its a quiz with a correct answer, BigBlueButton will indicate if the student selected the correct answer.

When publishing the results, it will also show the correct answer unless you **unselect** Display correct answers to all participants.

Here is what there the publish results look like in the chat with the correct result indicated.

You can also use quizzing with Smart Slides.  The following video gives you an overview of how this works.
