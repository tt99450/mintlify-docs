## A presenter in BigBlueButton has the ability to share an external audio/video with users in the live session.

The presenter role enables the assigned user the ability to share and control the video playback from an external video.

Using the **Share an external video** command, you can share a URL for

- YouTube
- Vimeo
- Instructure Media (previously called Arc)
- Twitch and Daily Motion
- Panopto
- Direct link to a .mp4 file, as in [https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/test/FredDixon.mp4](http://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/test/FredDixon.mp4)
- Direct link to a .mp3 file, as in [https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/test/audioSample.mp3](http://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/test/audioSample.mp3)
- Direct link to a .mp4/.mp3 file shared in DropBox (get a free dropbox account at [dropbox.com/basic](https://www.dropbox.com/basic) to upload your videos).

**It is important to note that the video playback will not appear in the processed recordings.**

By default, the first **Moderator** to enter the BigBlueButton session is allocated the presenter role capabilities; if you are a viewer you will need to request presenter status from the moderator.

When a user has the presenter role, the **presenter icon**will appear over their avatar in the users list.

**It is important to note that some mobile device browsers have auto playback of media turned off and the user will have to select play to engage the video playback.**

Audio from the video will play on each users' local system - no need to share an open audio source!
