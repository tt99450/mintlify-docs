You can also configure your room with custom settings to meet differing use cases.

- **Allow room to be recorded [1]:** By default, the room is not recorded or recordable. Selecting this will allow the moderator to record the meeting.
- **Require users to be signed in before joining [2]:**This setting if enabled requires users to be signed in to Personal Rooms before they can join.
- **Require moderator approval before joining [3]:** This setting will prompt the moderator to approve the join request of a user.
- **Allow any user to start this meeting [4]:** By default, only the room owner can start a room. When this setting is enabled all users who have access to the room link can start the room.
- **All users join as moderators [5]:** By default, only the room owner enters the room as a moderator. This setting allows you to assign moderator privileges to all users who have the room link.
- **Mute users when they join [6]:** This setting when enabled will automatically mute any user who joins with a microphone; it does not restrict their ability to unmute once in the live meeting.
- **Delete Room [7]:**Use this button to delete an unwanted room.  You will be prompted to confirm the deletion. **\*\*\* Deletion is permenant and can't be undone \*\*\***![](/images/21857807949965.png)
