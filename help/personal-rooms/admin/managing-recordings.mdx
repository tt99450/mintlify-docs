Use the **S****earch Bar** to filter based on the recording name, length, users, recording owner (room owner), visibility, and format. You can also **Sort** recordings based on the recording name, length, users, and visibility.

## Rename Recordings

Administrators (and the room owner) can rename room recordings that appear in the server recordings listing.

You can now edit or rename the recording. Once complete, click anywhere outside of the grey area to save the changes.

## Recording Visibility

Administrators (and the room owner) can change a recording's visibility.

![Screen_Shot_2019-10-24_at_11.17.47_AM.png](/images/360041468591.png)

By default all recordings are**Unlisted.** Only users who have the direct recording URL can view it.

Changing the visibility to **Public** allows anyone with the meeting room link access to the recording playback; users will see a recordings menu on the page where they joined the live session.

## Email or Delete Recordings

Administrators (and the room owner) can **Email or Delete** recordings.

![Screen_Shot_2019-10-24_at_11.17.29_AM.png](/images/360041470872.png)

Select the **V****ertical Ellipsis**or **H****amburger Menu** located to the right of the recording you wish to email or delete.

 It is important to note that selecting **Email** will open the email launcher you have installed on your desktop (outlook for example). It does not provide a direct recording URL.

Selecting **Delete**will permanently delete the recording and its statistic report.
