2. **Pending [2]**: Lists all user accounts that are awaiting an Administrator's approval .

Use the **S****earch Bar** to filter based on name, user name (email), authenticator or user creation date.

To filter based on role, select the specific role you wish to view from the **Role**column. You should see only the users with the assigned role selected.

## Delete, Ban, or Edit User Accounts

Administrators can Delete, Ban, or Edit each user account registered to their Personal Rooms instance.

Select the **Vertical Ellipsis**or **H****amburger Menu** located to the right of each user account.

To delete an account, select **Delete** from the account options.

It is important to note that this will remove the account from your Personal Rooms instance, however, does not prevent the user from signing up in the future with the same credentials.

To ban an account, select **Ban** from the account options.

This will both remove the user account and prevent the user from using the banned credentials to sign up for your Personal rooms instance in the future.

To edit an account, select **Edit**from the account options, and an edit user menu will open.

Administrators can edit the **A****ccount Name [1], Account Email [2], Account Role [3],**and add a **P****rofile Picture [4]** to the account.

When editing an account **R****ole [3]** it is important to note that though a user may be assigned multiple roles, only the role with the highest priority will be used to determine the user's account permissions.
