If your connection to BigBlueButton repeatedly reconnects, and you connecting from home, your router might be inadvertently closing your connection.

If this is the case (especially if you are using Spectrum in the US), you can resolve this by disabling IPV6 on your computer or router.

## Disable IPV6 on Windows 10

On Windows 10, right-click on the “**Network ![Windows 10 Network Icon](/images/4r4aezh4fi2hu3r1ummexkzcvq8ht7n7.png "Windows 10 Network Icon") / Wi-Fi****![Windows 10 Network Icon](/images/pyzl69tqpolp0rn9k36jhwo3ee0g9zuu.png "Windows 10 Network Icon")**” icon on the bottom-right corner of your screen.  You'll see a pop-up menu.

Click **Open Network and Sharing Center**.  You'll see the Settings dialog.

Click **Change adapter options** (highlighted in the picture above).  You'll see a list of network adaptors. Look for the currently active adaptor (it will be either **Ethernet**or **Wi-Fi**).

Right click on your active network adapter and select **Properties**.

In the **Properties** window, scroll down until you see **Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)**.

Un-check the **Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)** checkbox, click on **OK** to save the changes, and restart your computer.

6. Click the **OK** button.

Restart you Mac.

## Disable IPV6 on your Spectrum Router

If you have the **rac2v1k** spectrum router, you can disable IPV6 using router's web-based interface.

To login to the router's web-based interface, look for the URL and login password are on the back of the router.  It's likely [http://192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1/) and admin/admin.

Once logged in, click **Advanced** (at the top), then click **IPV6** (left-hand side), and then under IPV6 LAN settings, choose **Disable** (as show below)

then click **Apply**.

After a few moments, the router will indicate the update is complete.  Try logging into the BigBlueButton session again.
