# Accessibility

## Live Automatic Closed Captions

**Note:** This feature uses built-in Google APIs to enable live speech-to-text for a user.  This feature is disabled by default.  When BigBlueButton 2.6 release, to have this feature enabled for your account, contact Blindside Networks support. 

BigBlueButton now supports per-user captioning.  That is, when a user joins the audio, they can chooses which language they are speaking and, using Google's speech-to-text ability, BigBlueButton will make live transcription of their speech available to others.  These captions will also appear in the recordings.

To have your voice transcribed, select the desired language from the drop-down selector from the join audio dialog.

![mceclip3.png](/images/12025525358605)

When a user selects a language for automatic transcription, a CC icon will display next to their name in the “who is talking” indicator.

![mceclip4.png](/images/12026037739533)

When one or more users have enabled transcription, a CC button will appear.  To view the transcriptions for those with ‘CC’ in their “who is talking” icon, press the CC button.  You don’t need to have selected transcription of your audio to view the transcriptions for others.

The placement of the ‘CC’ button depends on your device.  For mobile devices, the ‘CC’ button is in the three dots at the top right corner.

![mceclip7.png](/images/12027795950861)

For desktop, the ‘CC’ button is in the bottom left.

![mceclip5.png](/images/12026422463373)

Desktop users can also select the language that the captioning will display in by pressing the up arrow on the CC button.

![mceclip6.png](/images/12026719839885)

Note: The automatic transcription is only available for browsers that support SpeechRecognition (Google Chrome, MS Edge, and Safari). If you join with non-supported browsers, you will see a warning at the bottom of the join audio dialog.
