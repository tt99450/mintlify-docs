BigBlueButton does have virtual background settings and you can change it. You can either choose one of the default choices or you can upload a custom background image.

To upload a custom background image click on the camera icon, then the plus (+) button.

You will then be able to select a background image (jpg, png or webp format) to upload from your computer.  The selected image will show up in the first position on the left in the list of available backgrounds to use.
