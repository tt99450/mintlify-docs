In hybrid classes, there is often a need to display a physical whiteboard or focus on a particular

student, or area of the classroom. You can now do this via a webcam shared to the main

content area.

\* Note the camera being shared can not be in use (as your main webcam) at the time of selection

## To share the camera as content
