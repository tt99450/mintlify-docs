We pleased to announce the following enhancements to BigBlueButton for increased security and moderation of a session.

**1. The PIN number for each conference is now 9 digits**

If your instance of BigBlueButton has dial-in numbers available, the dial-in + PIN number will appear in the chat.

The PIN numbers are now 9 digits in length.

When a user dials into your session, their phone number will appear in the User’s list in one of three formats (depending on their carrier):

1. 613265XXXX (phone number with last 4 digits masked)
2. Unknown (no caller ID)
3. FREDERICK DIXON (caller ID in upper case)

Here is an example of a phone user with caller ID.

As a moderator, you can click on the phone user.  A menu will appear letting you mute/unmute their microphone or remove them from the session.

**2. Removal of a user persists for the duration of the current session**

You can click on any name in the Users list (phone user or regular user), and choose [Remove user](/help/moderator-guide/promotedemoteremove-a-user).

Removal now persists for the duration of the session.  Specifically,

- If you remove a phone user, they won’t be able to dial back into the session from the same phone.
- If you remove a regular user, they won’t be able to rejoin the session in a similar manner.

For example, if a student joined through the learning management system (LMS), they would be unable to rejoin the current session through the LMS.  The same applies to a Personal Rooms link or Guest invite link.

Again, the removal is only for the current session.  A removed user can still join other BigBlueButton sessions or the same session again if restarted at a later time.
