Once engaged the multi-user capabilities, the whiteboard controls will appear on the right-hand side in the presentation area. There are two toolbars that can be used when interacting with the whiteboard. The **styles** toolbar contains tools that allow you to change the style (color, dash pattern, size, and fill) of your annotations along with undo and redo tools. The **tools** toolbar contains tools that allow you to interact with your annotations (grouping, aligning, rotating, etc.) and create new annotations with selection, pen, eraser, shapes, arrows, text, sticky notes, and delete tools.
