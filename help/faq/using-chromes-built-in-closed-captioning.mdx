Chrome v132.0 (and later) offers built-in captioning of all audio in a meeting.

You can enable live captioning by opening Chrome settings, Select **Advanced**, Select **Accessibility**, and enabling **Live Captions**.

Once enabled, you'll see a window at the bottom giving a live caption (English) of the meeting's audio.
