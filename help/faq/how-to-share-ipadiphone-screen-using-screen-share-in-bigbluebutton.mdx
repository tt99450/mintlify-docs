In order to share your iPad or iPhone screen during a BigBlueButton session, you must first also have a Mac on hand.

On your Mac, follow the steps in [this article](/help/faq/how-to-mirror-your-ipadiphone-screen-to-a-mac-computer-with-quicktime) to share your iPad/iPhone screen to your Mac.

Once that is done, you can then share the iPad/iPhone screen in the BigBlueButton session by clicking the "Share screen" button.

Once in the Screen Share menu, click **Window [1]** then select the **Movie Recording [2]** window which will be your iPad/iPhone screen.  Finally, click the **Share [3]** button.

The rest of the session will now see the iPad/iPhone screen.
