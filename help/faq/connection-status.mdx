The icon has three main colours which indicate your current connection status.

- Green - a good connection
- Purple - weakened connection
- Red - no connection

Clicking on the icon will provide more details regarding your connection.

Under the first tab of the connection status page, you will see details regarding your audio upload/download rates, video upload download rates, Jitter, Lost packets, and if you are using a TURN server for your connection.

You can copy the connection status stats by using the Copy Stats button in the bottom right-hand corner.

This will copy the details of the meeting and user connection information into a text format.  Below is an example of the copied stats.
