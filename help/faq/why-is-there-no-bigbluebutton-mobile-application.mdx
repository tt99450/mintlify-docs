By design, BigBlueButton is a fully HTML5 web application.  It runs with a browser on Desktop, Laptop, Chromebook, and mobile devices.

On mobile, BigBlueButton runs within the Mobile browser (Safari mobile on iOS and Chrome mobile on Android).

As such, users don't need to install any mobile app to run BigBlueButton.  They are always running the latest version.
