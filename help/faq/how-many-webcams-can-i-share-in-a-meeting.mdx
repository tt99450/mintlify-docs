BigBlueButton is not designed as a purely video conferencing application, but rather it focuses on engagement with students (breakout rooms, shared notes, multi-user whiteboard, etc.).

For most Premium Tier accounts, you can share webcams in BigBlueButton and students can see each other by unlocking the **See other viewers webcams** (in the [lock settings](/help/moderator-guide/lock-viewers-ability-to-use-their-micwebcamchatshared-notes)).

BigBlueButton will dynamically adjust the number of webcams moderators and viewers see based on the number of users in the session.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Number of Users** | **Webcams moderator can view** | **Webcams viewers can view** |
| >30 | 25 | 6 |
| >40 | 20 | 5 |
| >50 | 16 | 4 |
| >60 | 8 | 4 |
| >70 | 8 | 3 |
| >80 | 8 | 2 |
| >100 | 8 | 2 |

Right now, there are no hard-coded limits in the webcam sharing, but the above guidelines will ensure you and your students have a good experience.

If a student is on low bandwidth, they [elect to can turn off webcams for their client](/help/user-guide/access-the-options-menu) via the Options menu.

Viewers now see (up to) five (5) webcams at a time.
