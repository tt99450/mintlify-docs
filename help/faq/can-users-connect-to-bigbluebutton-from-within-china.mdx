We are committed to making BigBlueButton accessible globally.

BigBlueButton is a web-based application that runs within your browser (no software to install).  When the BigBlueButton client loads within your browser, it connects and joins you to a virtual class running on the remote BigBlueButton server.

Blindside Networks hosts BigBlueButton servers in Europe, North America, Asia Pacific, and Canada.

However, for users within China, they must connect to outside servers through the Great Chinese Firewall (GCF).  As such, connections to these servers -- including BigBlueButton servers -- are subject restrictions of the GCF.  These restrictions may include no constraints (full access), throttling of the connection, or even blocking access to a server.

For such users, if you are having difficulty accessing or maintaining a connection to BigBlueButton, given China has three main telecom providers, we recommend try switching between the providers.  You may also try using a subscription-based Virtual Private Network (VPN) client where such clients will create an encrypted network through the GCF for access to outside servers.
