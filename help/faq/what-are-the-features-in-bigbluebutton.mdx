BigBlueButton has all the core features you would expect in a web conferencing system.

Unlike generic web conferencing systems, BigBlueButton is designed for online learning; it extends these core features to enable an educator to engage students in virtual office hours, group collaboration, and full online classes.

For example, a tutor can engage students using the multi-user whiteboard to help a student with solving a difficult math problem.
