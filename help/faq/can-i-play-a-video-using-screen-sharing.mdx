The best way to share a YouTube, Vimeo, or Canvas Studio video is through the built-in [Share external video](/help/presenter-guide/share-an-external-audiovideo-link) option.

However, if you want to use the [Screen sharing](/help/presenter-guide/share-my-screen) to share a video (start screen sharing and then play the video on your screen outside of BigBlueButton),  **we recommend using the Chrome browser.**

When sharing a Chrome Tab, Window, or Enteri Screen, enable **Also share system audio**.
