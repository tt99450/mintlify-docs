title: "Can I play a video using screen sharing?"
description: "Use the built-in share external video option first, then screen sharing as a backup."

The best way to share a YouTube, Vimeo, or Canvas Studio video is through the built-in [Share external video](/help/presenter-guide/share-an-external-audiovideo-link) option.  This instructs each user's browser to load the video directly.

However, if you want to use the [Screen sharing](/help/presenter-guide/share-my-screen) to share a video (start screen sharing and then play the video on your screen outside of BigBlueButton),  we recommend using the Chrome browser**.**

When using Chrome enable **Also share system audio**.

<Warning>
  Share externail video is the most efficient, but the video won't appear in the recording as the user's browser directly plays the video (it does not go through the server).
