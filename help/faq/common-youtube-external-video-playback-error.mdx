then you can resolve this error by clearning YouTube's cookies from your browser.

To clear the cookies, go to the Chrome menu (upper right-hand corner) and choose  **More Tools -> Developer Tools**, then click the **Application**tab.  You'll see an entry on the left-hand side for Cookies.

Click to expand '**Cookies**', and then on the [https://www.youtube](https://www.youtube/) entry, right click and choose '**Clear**'.  
  
After that, you will be able to share a YouTube video as normal again.
