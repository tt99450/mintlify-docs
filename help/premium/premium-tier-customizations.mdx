As part of upgrading to the Premium Tier hosting for BigBlueButton, Blindside Networks can customize various settings for your account.

If you want any of these settings (shown below) changed, just contact your Blindside Networks Customer Success Manager with description of the changes.

## Custom Welcome Message

When users join, they see a welcome message in the chat (with a grey background).

We can customize the welcome message to whatever you want.

## Show Dial-In Number only to Moderator

All accounts in North America have a default dial-in number, and by default the number is visible to both instructors and students.

Some schools (especially K12) may want the dial-in number only visible to the moderator. For example, the second welcome message is only visible to the instructor.

We can set whatever custom welcome message you want for the instructor.

## Default Lock Settings

Each instructor can use the Lock viewers to restrict viewers from accessing certain features

Blindside Networks can specify for your account to have any of these lock settings as default.

For example, you may want students to not share:

- microphone
- private chat messages
- edit shared notes

With these settings as default, each session will start with the following lock settings in effect

## Ability to unmute users

By default, for privacy, a moderator cannot unmute another user's microphone.  However, for K12, this is very useful for the educator to unmute a student's microphone.

## Mute users

By default, users joining with microphone are unmuted.  We can set this so all users join as muted.

## Auto-Expire of Recordings

If your school wants a policy that all recordings are automatically deleted after two years (730 days), for example, we can setup the auto deletion.  Just let know know how many days you want the recordings to last.

## Protected Recording Link

We can enable Protected Recording Links in your account, which will prevent viewers from copying and sharing recording links.

## Don't record student webcams

We can configure your account so student webcams are not visible in the recordings.

## No recordings

We can configure your account so no sessions are recorded.

## Hide Viewer/Student names in chat of recordings

We can conceal student names in the chat in recordings.  The student/viewer names will show up as Viewer and the moderator/instructor names will show as normal.

## Automatically end session when no moderators are present

We can set an interval (such as 2 minutes) that when a session has started and a moderator is no longer present, BigBlueButton will automatically end the session.  This is useful in K12 where you want to prevent scenarios where the educator gets disconnected from a session (such as loosing internet), and their students are left behind unsupervised.

## Custom Logo

We can place your logo in the upper left-hand corner of the BigBlueButton session.

## Custom background image for webcam URL

For additional branding, you can provide us an PNG or JPEG image at a HTTPS URL, and we can configure your account to use this as the default webcam background. 

Users would still be able to upload their own background if they wanted.

## Automatic transfer of recordings to S3 bucket

## We can setup workflow so that once our infrastructure finishes processing of a recording, we can automatically transfer it to a write-only S3 bucket, hosted by the customer, along with a manifest with meta-data about the recording.
