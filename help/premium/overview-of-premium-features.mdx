Blindside Networks offers hosting for BigBlueButton with the following [Premium Features](https://blindsidenetworks.com/hosting/).  If you're using the "Free Tier" (built-in version) of BigBlueButton within your learning management system (LMS), these features listed below are available when you upgrade to Premium Tier hosting.

You can upgrade by contacting your LMS provider (Instructure, Schoology, Jenzabar, Moodle Partner) as they resell our Premium Tier hosting directly.

## Enhanced Recordings

### Recordings as video files

The recordings are a single video file that contains all content except chat (which is displayed on the right-hand side as the video plays back) and videos shared via "Share video" option.

### Recordings are permanent

Recordings do not expire.  They persist until they are deleted.

### Recordings are downloadable

When viewing a recording, you can right-click within the video area and choose "Save video as .." to [download the recording](/help/premium/how-do-i-download-a-recording).

### Recordings are protected (optional)

When providing the recording links to the LMS, our servers can generate temporary links that are only viewable by a single person.  In other words, a student viewing a recording can't copy the recording and share it with another.

### Integration with Canvas Studio

If you have Canvas Studio, we can configure your account to [automatically upload recordings from completed conferences into Studio and share them with the instructor's account](/integrations/canvas/faq-integration-with-canvas-studio).

# Meeting Analytics

For each recorded session, your instructors will also see a 'statistics' playback format that answers questions such as:

- Who attended?
- How long did they attend?
- What activities did they participate in (talking, chatting, raising hand, emojis)?
- What response did they provide to polling?

All this data is downloadable as a CSV file that can be imported into a spreadsheet.  See [statistics recording format](https://blindsidenetworks.com/statistics).  All the times in the statistics reports are currently in UTC.

# Personal Rooms

If you use Office 365 or Google Apps to authenticate your instructor's e-mail accounts, we can provide you an interface outside your LMS to create rooms, invite users, and manage recordings.  The created rooms will have permanent URLs.

See the [Personal Rooms admin guide](/help/admin/site-settings).

# Invite guest

Your moderators have the ability to [invite guests](/help/premium/how-do-i-invite-a-guest-to-a-live-meeting) into the session.

# Dial-in number

By default, there is a dial-in number for all sessions in North America.  For Canada, Europe, and Asia/Pacific we can provide a dial-in number as well for an additional cost.

# Account Customization

We can configure your account to have specific [Premium Tier customizations](/help/premium/premium-tier-customizations) that include:

- Welcome message
- Show/hide dial-in number to users
- Default lock settings
- Longer sessions than 540 minutes

# Frequently Asked Questions

## How does the cost of Premium Tier get calculated?

The costs for the Premium Tier are calculated by the maximum number of concurrent sessions (or, in some cases for K12 schools, the maximum number of concurrent users) that you may have running at any one time.   A concurrent session is any BigBlueButton session that has two or more users and runs for more than 15 minutes.

In practice, you'll have multiple sessions running throughout the day.  The more sessions you have running at the same time, the more capacity we must provide, hence we charge based on concurrency.

A concurrent session is not tied to a specific user.  There is no second layer to login.   Instructors and students enter a BigBlueButton session, they click on the link within the LMS and join a session, and BigBlueButton opens in their browser.

For details on pricing, reach out to your LMS provider or [contact us](https://blindsidenetworks.com/contact/) directly.

## Can I track my concurrent sessions?

Yes.  We can provide you a URL that will show you a graph of your peak concurrent sessions.

## What happens if I exceed the number of concurrent sessions?

BigBlueButton will still work (we don't hard-code the limit for concurrent sessions). However, if we see that your usage going significantly above the number of purchased concurrent sessions, we will reach out to you to purchase additional concurrent sessions to cover the increased usage.
