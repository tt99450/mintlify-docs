Blindside Networks continues focus on the needs of educational institutions for online classes.

This page lists some of the common requests that we have received (subject to change based on customer demand).

## Auto Closed Captioning

BigBlueButton supports live closed captioning with the assistance of a stenographer.  The captions will appear in the recordings as subtitles.

If you are using Instructure Canvas and have Studio (which can do automatic captions), we can integrate your BigBlueButton recording with Studio (they will automatically appear as shared recordings with the instructor), and you can use Studio's built-in captioning.

Today, most schools that need captions will [download your recordings](/help/premium/how-do-i-download-a-recording) and upload it to a 3rd party captioning service.

Blindside Networks plans automatic captioning via 3rd party commercial captioning services (TBD).
