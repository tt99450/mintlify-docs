## Recordings take up to 24 hours to process

If you do not see your recording in a few hours, it is likely in the processing queue and will be available shortly. In most cases a recording will soon (within 24 hours).

## If you still do not see a recording available for viewing....

During the session, you must indicate which segments you want to have processed into the recording.  You do this by clicking the Start/Resume record button.

If you **did not** click the Start/Resume record button, then it is not possible to recover the recording.
