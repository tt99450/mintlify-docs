In the Premium Tier hosting, when users are viewing a recording, they can right-click on the video and choose "Save Video As..." to download the recording.

This feature is a function of the browser.  Even if Blindside Networks disabled this feature with JavaScript, it ultimately wouldn't prevent a determined user from downloading the recording.

They could still, for example, view the network traffic and obtain the URL for the recording itself.

They could also record their screen while the recording is playing and thus capture it into their own video file.

As a result, we have not tried to restrict the ability to "Save video as..." in BigBlueButton.
