## You can use BigBlueButtonBN activities to host virtual lectures, hold online office hours, and coordinate student groups.

Once an administrator has successfully installed the latest version of the BigBlueButtonBN Activity Module, instructors and their students will have full access to BigBlueButton’s capabilities from within their Moodle interface. 

If you cannot create a BigBlueButtonBN activity, your institution has restricted this feature. Contact your Moodle Administrator for more information.

## To create a new conference

Navigate to the course you wish to add your BigBlueButtonBN activity to.
