## The schedule for a session enables you to create a BigBlueButtonBN Activity that has specific open and close times.

In Moodle you can schedule your BigBlueButtonBN activity or room, which "locks the door" to your conference before and/or after a specific date and time.

To view the scheduling options, expand the **schedule for session**menu.

By default, the BigBlueButtonBN activity plug in has the schedule function disabled. To schedule a start or end time be sure to check **enable**. 

The session can be scheduled to have a **start time only,** an **end time only,**or **both**.

***IMPORTANT TO NOTE: Unlike the “wait for moderator” setting, adding and enabling an open/close date and time restricts a user's ability to join a session before the join open time or after the join closed time.***

Once saved, the scheduled session will also appear in the calendar view of the respective course.

Enrolled users will not see a join session button until the scheduled activity time. They will instead see a message that the conference has not started yet, including the scheduled join open/close date and time.

Once the conference is open, invitees will see the **join** option available until the close time.

Any invited attendees attempting to join after the close date and time will no longer be presented with a **join**option.
