The version can be found either using an Admin account and navigating to:

Dashboard -> Site administration -> Plugins -> Plugins overview -> BigBlueButtonBN

Or editing the file version.php directly in the plugin directory:

$plugin->version = 9999999999;

So, let's assume we have versions:

**My old BBB plugins on Moodle 3.0.9:**

1) mod\_bigbluebuttonbn version 2015062101

**The new BBB plugins that I wanted to use on Moodle 3.0.9:**

1) mod\_bigbluebuttonbn version 2016051919

**Pre-installation steps:**

a) I have the code in a [git](https://moodle.org/mod/glossary/showentry.php?eid=10110&displayformat=dictionary "Glossary of common terms: Git") repository so if I need to, I can checkout the folders and revert the file changes.

b) It is important to keep a back up of the tables that the plugins use. From their "db/install.[xml](https://moodle.org/mod/glossary/showentry.php?eid=9348&displayformat=dictionary "Glossary of common terms: XML")", there are two tables:  
   b.1) bigbluebuttonbn and bigbluebuttonbn\_log for bigbluebuttonbn

c) I exported the tables one by one:

c.1)   my[sql](https://moodle.org/mod/glossary/showentry.php?eid=6851&displayformat=dictionary "Glossary of common terms: SQL")dump -u MYUSERNAME -p MYDATABASE mdl\_bigbluebuttonbn > /tmp/moodlelive\_bigbluebuttonbn\_table.sql  
c.2)   mysqldump -u MYUSERNAME -p MYDATABASE mdl\_bigbluebuttonbn\_log > /tmp/moodlelive\_bigbluebuttonbnlog\_table.sql

**Upgrade steps:**

a) rm -rf mod/bigbluebuttonbn

c) Then, I  'wget' and 'unzip' the zip files from the Moodle plugin directory, in my mod folder.

d) From the front-end, I followed the steps and upgraded the plugins.

Let's suppose that I am not happy with the new plugins; something does not work and I want to downgrade. At this stage, if I have created new meetings, they will be lost, if I apply the following steps, so please make sure that you only want to downgrade without migrating any "new" data.

**Downgrade steps:**

a) rm -rf mod/bigbluebuttonbn

b) git checkout -- mod/bigbluebuttonbn

*At the moment, I have got the old plugin files that were stored in my GIT repository.*

c) A table in the [database](https://moodle.org/mod/glossary/showentry.php?eid=15&displayformat=dictionary "Glossary of common terms: database") keeps the new versions of the plugins that I installed. I must update these values otherwise Moodle will never use the older plugins versions and I will not be able to downgrade!

c.1) ID for mod\_bigbluebuttonbn: select \* from mdl\_config\_plugins where plugin = 'mod\_bigbluebuttonbn';

c.3) update mdl\_config\_plugins set value = '2015062101' where id = THE\_ID\_FROM e.1;

c.4) update mdl\_config\_plugins set value = '2014070401' where id = THE\_ID\_FROM e.2;

d) So, up until now we have put in place the older versions in the database and we need to import the backups:

d.1) [mysql](https://moodle.org/mod/glossary/showentry.php?eid=27&displayformat=dictionary "Glossary of common terms: MySQL") -u MYUSERNAME -p MYDATABASE < /tmp/moodlelive\_bigbluebuttonbn\_table.sql

d.2) mysql -u MYUSERNAME -p MYDATABASE < /tmp/moodlelive\_bigbluebuttonbnlog\_table.sql

Refreshing the front-end will prompt you to update the database. Click on the button and then check if you can use the plugins - perhaps you will need to update the server and the [URL](https://moodle.org/mod/glossary/showentry.php?eid=31&displayformat=dictionary "Glossary of common terms: URL") of BBB [server](https://moodle.org/mod/glossary/showentry.php?eid=30&displayformat=dictionary "Glossary of common terms: server") on the appropriate screen.
