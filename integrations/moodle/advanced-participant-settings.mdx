By default, the BigBlueButtonBN room/activity sets participants to the above configuration. All users enrolled in the course are set to enter as **viewers** and the owner is set to enter as a **moderator.**

Participants can be added to the room/activity based on their assigned **roles** in Moodle or by an individual enrolled **user**.

To add participants based on their assigned roles in Moodle, first select **roles** from the participants drop down.

Next, select a specific assigned role you'd like to add to the BigBlueButtonBN room/activity, then select **add.**

When adding users, only individuals who have been enrolled in the Moodle course will appear in the drop down list.

***IMPORTANT: Each role may have varying conference permissions based on how they have been configured in Moodle by the course administrator when created.***

All added users appear under the owner of the activity in the participants list. The BigBlueButtonBN room/activity sets participants added to the list as **viewers** by default.
