## Once you have created a BigBlueButtonBN Activity you can access additional activity/room settings.

The activity/room settings allow you to:

- Create a custom welcome message
- Restrict viewers from entering the room until a moderator has arrived
- Set the session to be recorded

## Custom Welcome Message

Adding a**Welcome Message** replaces the default message set up for the BigBlueButton server displayed in the chat.  When adding a welcome message, we recommend avoiding special characters and symbols such as ampersand (&) and the percentage sign (%).

### IMPORTANT: the welcome message is HTML based and will not accept copied and pasted text from a word editing program (such as Microsoft word). We recommend typing directly into the message field or using a TEXT editor, such as notepad.  Paste your copied text into notepad to strip away any HTML codes, then copy and paste the text from notepad into the welcome message.

## Wait for Moderator

Checking the **Wa****it for Moderator** box restricts viewers ability to enter a session.

When this setting is enabled, any viewer attempt to join your session will see the message **Waiting for moderator to join.**  Once you have joined, those users will automatically join the session.

## Set the session to be recorded

By default, the BigBlueButtonBN plugin checks this option.

If you uncheck this option, the Start/Stop Recording button will **NOT** appear in your sessions and the server will not record any content.

### IMPORTANT: We recommend leaving **Session can be recorded option** enabled. In the event you forgot to click the Start/Stop Record button, Blindside Networks can still retrieve and reprocess the recording 14 days from the date it was held.
