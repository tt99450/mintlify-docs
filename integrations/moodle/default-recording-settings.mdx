## BigBlueButtonBN activities can be enabled to provide a recording option during a live virtual session.

When enabled, the Room/Activity will allow the moderator to engage the start/stop record button in the live session to generate a viewable and shareable recording link.

By default, BigBlueButtonBN Activities are enabled to be recorded when the instance type chosen is **Room/Activity with recordings** or when **session can be recorded** is checked.

## Locating Processed Recordings
