## In canvas you can set a duration time that "locks the door" to your conference after the duration has expired.

In the above example, the **Duration** is set to 60 minutes.  When the conference is created, use can enter the conference anytime over the next 60 minutes.

What happens when the 60 minutes is over?  When the duration expires, participants will be unable to join.

The expiry of the duration does not effect the running session: it will continue until one of the following conditions are reached

Within the BigBlueButton session:

- last person leaves the session, or
- a moderator ends the session,
- or **the session exceeds the maximum length of 9 hours (540 minutes)**

Within Canvas

- The teacher Ends the conference within the Canvas UI

Think the Duration as a door to the conference room.  Once it locks, people can't enter the conference room anymore, but users inside the room can continue until their session finishes.

Once the Duration duration is reached, conference will appear in the Concluded section on subsequent page refreshes in Canvas.
