Canvas as a great calendar feature called [Appointment Group](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/How-do-I-add-an-appointment-group-in-a-course-calendar/ta-p/617602), which gives you the ability to set a range of time slots where student can sign up.

You can link these time slots directly to a BigBlueButton conference, enabling students who sign up for your appointments to join you in a BigBlueButton session with a single click.

Here how to set it up.

First, create a BigBlueButton conference in your course.  Select **No time limit** so you can re-use the conference, and select **Enable waiting room** so students can't join unless you are present.

Click **Create** to create the conference (you can use an existing conference as well).

Once the conference created, you'll copy the URL for starting/joining the conference.  To copy to the clipboard, point at the Start/Join link, right-click in your browser, and choose **Copy Link address**.

This copies the URL, which looks like this

  https://blindside.instructure.com/courses/9/conferences/1009/join

What is this URL? Whenever a student clicks the Join button, Canvas opens this static URL to join this specific conferene.

Next, create an **Appointments Group** in your course calendar.  In the image below, we've created six 30 minute appointments between 9:00 am and 12:00 pm.

Notice in the above screen shot we've pasted in the copied Join link into the **Details** field.  Select **Publish**.

Now, whenever students sign up for an appointment for your Office Hours, they will have clickable link to join your office hours (Canvas helpfully turned the pasted link into a clickable link).

Let's say it's 9:00 am on the morning of the appointments.  When you start the BigBlueButton conference, you can use the **guest policy** to enable BigBlueButton's built-in waiting room.  This lets you manage students as they join.

To setup the built-in waiting room, click the gear icon and choose **Guest policy**.

Select, **Ask Moderator**

Now, when a student wants to join, you'll hear a sound and BigBlueButton will show them in the **Waiting Users** panel.

You can messuage waiting users, and then click the '(+)' button when you want them to join.

This is helpful if your running a few moments late with the previous student.  Once you finish up, you can enable the next waiting student to join.
