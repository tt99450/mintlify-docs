For Canvas customers that upgrade to Premium Tier hosting for Conferences, if you have Studio (Canvas's video content management system), then we can configure your Premium Tier account to automatically upload recordings into Studio and share it with the Instructor's account.

For example, here's a screen shot showing recordings from Conferences shared in the Instructor's account.

To configure the upload, we will need a studio account for making API requests.  The account must have privileges to sign into your `<canvas_sitename>`.instructuremedia.com (such as myuniversity.instructuremedia.com) and have privileges to upload videos and share them with other accounts.

To get started, contact your Blindside Networks Customer Success Manager and we'll work with you to setup and test Studio integration for your Premium Tier account.
