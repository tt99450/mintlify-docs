## Conferences created to be long running (no end time) can be edited manually to include late registrants.

If a Canvas BigBlueButton Conference activity has already been created and students are registered to the course at a later date they can be manually added to the Conference activity.

**Note: This only applies to long running conferences; conferences that are in progress or have concluded can not be edited.**

## To add late registrants:

Then choose **invite all course members [1]** and select **update [2]** to save the changes.

Refresh the Conferences page.

All course members, including late registrants, will now have access to the conference and ability to view any subsequent recordings.
