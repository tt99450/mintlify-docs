## Canvas by Instructure has integrated BigBlueButton as Canvas Conferences.

It has a built-in version of BigBlueButton that is available to all Canvas customers.

Conferences are primarily used for virtual lectures, virtual office hours, and student groups. Instructors can easily create conferences and invite students, and students can use conferences from within student groups.

### **\*\***Creating a conference is a course permission. If you cannot create a conference, your institution has restricted this feature\*\*
