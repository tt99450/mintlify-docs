## In Canvas Conferences, when a conference is enabled for recording the Moderator must still engage the Start/Stop button in the live session.

If a conference is enabled for recording when it was created, the moderator in the live session will have access to the Start/Stop recording button located in the upper right hand corner of the BigBlueButton interface.

It is important to note that the enable recording is **not** an auto capture function and the moderator must still select the recording button to begin the recording capture.

When engaged, a prompt will appear to confirm you wish to begin recording. The button will change to **light blue** with a **red** indicator and a counter will appear to display the number of minutes that have been recorded from the session.

If you do not see the Start/Stop record button your session was not enabled to be recorded when it was created in Canvas. Be sure to log out of the current meeting before editing the conference settings.

Any edits applied to a live meeting will not show until it has been left by all attendees and restarted.
