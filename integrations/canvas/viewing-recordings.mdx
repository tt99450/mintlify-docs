In Canvas BigBlueButton Conferences, when a conference has a recording you will see a small triangle to the left of the conference title.

Clicking the triangle will expand the conference to show a list of all available recordings.

Clicking on **video** will then open the recording and play it in a new window.  (You may see different recording formats in your instance of Canvas).
