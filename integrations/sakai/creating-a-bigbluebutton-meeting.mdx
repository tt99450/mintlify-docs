## You can use BigBlueButton meetings to host one-on-one tutoring, virtual lectures, and hold online office hours.

Once successfully installed, instructors and their students will have full access to BigBlueButton’s capabilities from within their Sakai interface.

## To create a new conference

Navigate to the course you wish to add a meeting to.

Select **meetings** from the menu options available

Then choose **create meeting.**

Once created, the meeting's settings page will display the different configuration options that can be applied or edited to create your preferred virtual classroom setting.

## Meeting information

Under the meeting information settings you can add a name and description to the virtual classroom, enable recording, engage the wait for moderator setting, and pre-upload a presentation.

The meeting **title [1]**and **description [2]**are displayed when users join the session. We recommend assigning a unique meeting title to each new meeting created.

When **recording [3]**is enabled, the start/stop record button in the live session will be available for a moderator to engage to generate a viewable, shareable recording link.

It is important to note that the recording option must be enabled for recording recovery in the event the moderator does not engage the start/stop during the live session.

![Screen_Shot_2018-11-21_at_3.04.24_PM.png](/images/Screen_Shot_2018-11-21_at_3.04.24_PM.png)Checking the **wait for moderator** **[4]** box restricts a viewer's ability to enter a session until a moderator joins.

When this setting is enabled, any viewer attempting to join your session will see the message **"****waiting for moderator to join"**. Once you (or the moderator) have joined, those users will automatically join the meeting.

The **pre-upload presentation [5]**option enables you to load a document that will be available in the live BigBlueButton session.

By default, meeting participants are set to the above configuration; where all users enrolled in the course are set to enter as **viewers** and the owner or Sakai Administrator is set to enter as a **moderator.**

Participants can be added to the room/activity based on their assigned **roles** or by individual enrolled **user**.
