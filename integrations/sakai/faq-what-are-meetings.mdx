## Sakai has the ability to integrate BigBlueButton as Sakai Meetings.

It has a version of BigBlueButton that is available to Sakai customers who choose to install the free tier or who choose to upgrade to the premium tier.

Meetings are primarily used for virtual lectures, virtual office hours, and student groups. Instructors can easily create conferences and invite students, and students can use conferences from within student groups.

### **\*\***Creating a meeting is a course permission. If you cannot create a BigBlueButton meeting, your institution has restricted this feature\*\*
