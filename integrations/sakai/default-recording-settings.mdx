## BigBlueButton meetings can be enabled to provide a recording option during a live virtual session.

When enabled, the meeting will allow the moderator to engage the start/stop record button in the live session to generate a viewable, shareable recording link.

By default, BigBlueButton meetings are enabled to be recorded.

## \*Important to note that this is not an auto capture feature\*

In order to produce a recording of a meeting the moderator or instructor has to enable the start/stop record option by selecting the **recording button,**which is located in the upper middle of the BigBlueButton interface.

When the session is being recorded the icon will change from greyscale to **blue with a red indicator**, and a count up of active recorded minutes will show.

## Locating processed recordings

Recordings are tied to the meeting activity they were created under. Processed recording links and their statistics reports will appear under meeting's **recordings**tab.
