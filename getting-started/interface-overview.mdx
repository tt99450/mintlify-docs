The BigBlueButton interface is organized into distinct regions, each serving a specific purpose during your session.

## Interface Regions

### Toolbar (Top)

The toolbar at the top of the screen provides quick access to session-wide controls:

- **Audio controls** — join/leave audio, mute/unmute your microphone
- **Webcam toggle** — start or stop sharing your camera
- **Screen share** — share your screen or application window
- **Raise hand** — signal to the moderator that you have a question
- **Reactions** — send quick emoji reactions to the session

### User List (Left Panel)

The user list shows all participants in the session:

- See who is a **moderator**, **presenter**, or **viewer**
- View participant status indicators (raised hand, away, etc.)
- Moderators can manage users from this panel (mute, promote, remove)

See [Manage Users](/help/moderator-guide/manage-users) for moderator controls.

### Chat Panel (Left Panel)

The chat panel supports both public and private messaging:

- **Public chat** — visible to all participants
- **Private chat** — one-on-one messages between participants
- Save or copy chat messages for reference

See [Send Public and Private Chat Messages](/help/user-guide/send-public-and-private-chat-messages).

### Presentation Area (Center)

The main content area displays:

- Uploaded **presentations** (PDF, slides)
- **Screen shares** from the presenter
- **External videos** shared by the presenter
- The **whiteboard** for annotations and collaborative drawing

Presenters control navigation using [Presentation Controls](/help/presenter-guide/use-the-presentation-controls).

### Webcam Area

Webcams can be positioned in different areas depending on your layout:

- **Webcam pagination** — navigate through multiple webcam feeds. See [Webcam Pagination](/help/releases/webcam-pagination-and-active-talker).
- **Pin a webcam** — keep a specific webcam visible. See [Pin a Webcam](/help/releases/how-do-i-pin-a-webcam).
- **Move webcams** — reposition the webcam area. See [Move Webcams](/help/user-guide/move-webcams-in-a-live-session).

## Screen Layouts

BigBlueButton offers several layout options to optimize your view:

- **Default layout** — balanced view of presentation and webcams
- **Grid layout** — equal-sized tiles for all webcam feeds. See [Grid Layout](/help/releases/screen-layout-grid-layout).
- **Custom layouts** — moderators can push a layout to all participants. See [Push Layout](/help/releases/as-a-moderator-how-can-i-push-my-layout-to-everyone).

See [Change Screen Layout](/help/releases/how-do-i-change-the-screen-layout) and [Layout Options](/help/faq/where-are-the-layout-options) for details.
