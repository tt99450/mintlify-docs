## Built for Teaching

BigBlueButton is the world's most widely used open-source virtual classroom, with over **2 billion minutes** of sessions delivered. Unlike general-purpose video conferencing tools, every feature in BigBlueButton is designed around how people actually teach and learn.

Our design draws on research-backed frameworks:

- **Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development** — tools for scaffolding and guided collaboration (breakout rooms, shared notes, multi-user whiteboard)
- **Bloom's Taxonomy** — features that move learners from recall to creation (polls for checking understanding, collaborative activities, learning analytics)
- **Active Learning Principles** — built-in engagement tools that keep students participating, not just watching

## The Prepare → Educate → Reflect Workflow
