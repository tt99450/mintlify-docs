## First-Day Checklist

Run through these steps before your first live session:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test your audio">
    Join a session and complete the audio echo test. Confirm you can hear yourself and that your microphone is working. See [Join the Audio](/help/user-guide/join-the-audio).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test your webcam">
    Enable your webcam and verify the preview looks correct. Adjust lighting so your face is clearly visible. See [Share a Webcam](/help/user-guide/share-a-webcam).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload a test presentation">
    Upload a PDF or slide deck to make sure it renders correctly. Check that all pages appear and text is readable. See [Upload a Presentation](/help/presenter-guide/upload-a-presentation-enable-for-download).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Try screen sharing">
    Share your screen or a specific application window. Verify participants would see what you intend. See [Share My Screen](/help/presenter-guide/share-my-screen).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore the interface">
    Familiarize yourself with the toolbar, chat panel, user list, and presentation area. See [Interface Overview](/getting-started/interface-overview).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>If you run into issues during testing, check the [Troubleshooting](/reference/troubleshooting) guide.</Note>
