description: Setting up BN Analytics with your LMS
---

Blindside Networks will configure your account instance to both display data (BN Alerts) from the LMS and send data (BN Reports) to your LMS.

The setup is different depending on if you use Moodle or Canvas. See the following pages for LMS-specific configuration:

- [Configuration for Moodle](/analytics/moodle)
- [Configuration for Canvas](/analytics/canvas)
