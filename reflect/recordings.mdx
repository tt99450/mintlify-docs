BigBlueButton can record your sessions for later review by students or for your own reflection.

## Start and Stop Recording

Moderators control when recording is active:

- Click the **Record** button to start capturing the session
- Click again to pause recording
- You can start and stop multiple times — they'll be combined into one recording
- A visual indicator shows all participants when recording is active

See [Start and Stop Recording](/help/moderator-guide/start-and-stop-recording).

<Note>Recording only captures content when actively recording. Paused segments are not included.</Note>

## Recording Formats

BigBlueButton recordings are available in different formats:

| Format | Content | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Presentation** | Slides + audio + chat + shared notes | Reviewing lectures |
| **Video** | Full video recording with webcams | Visual review |
| **Statistics** | Engagement data and participation metrics | Analytics and reflection |

## Processing Time

Recordings are not available immediately after a session ends:

- Processing time varies based on session length and server load
- Typical processing: minutes to hours depending on duration
- You'll receive access once processing completes

See [How Long Until My Recording Is Available?](/help/premium/how-long-until-my-recording-is-available-for-viewing).

## Download Recordings

Premium users can download recordings for offline viewing or archival:

See [Download a Recording](/help/premium/how-do-i-download-a-recording).

## Recording Security

Control who can access and download your recordings:

- **Prevent downloads** — restrict recordings to online viewing only. See [Prevent Users from Downloading a Recording](/help/premium/can-i-prevent-users-from-downloading-a-recording).
- **Access control** — recordings inherit the access settings of your room or LMS course

## Tips for Better Recordings

<Tip>
- **Start recording early** — don't forget to click Record at the start of class
- **Pause during breaks** — stop recording during non-instructional time
- **Announce recording** — let participants know when recording is active
- **Review your recordings** — watch your own recordings to improve your teaching
