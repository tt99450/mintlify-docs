After your session ends, use BigBlueButton's analytics tools to review what happened and improve future sessions.

## Statistics Recording

When recording is enabled, BigBlueButton generates a **statistics recording** alongside the presentation and video formats:

- View aggregate participation metrics
- See talk time distribution across participants
- Review poll results and response patterns
- Identify engagement peaks and drops

## Learning Analytics Dashboard (Post-Session)

The Learning Analytics Dashboard data from your session can be reviewed after class:

- **Activity scores** — which students were most and least engaged
- **Timeline data** — when engagement dropped (may indicate confusing content)
- **Poll/quiz results** — which questions students struggled with
- **CSV export** — download data for detailed analysis

See [Learning Analytics Dashboard](/help/moderator-guide/learning-analytics-dashboard).

## LMS Analytics

If you use BigBlueButton through an LMS (Canvas, Moodle, or Sakai), session data can be sent back to your LMS for centralized reporting:

  <Card title="Analytics Configuration" icon="gear" href="/analytics/configuration">
    Set up analytics data flow to your LMS.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Reflection Questions

Use these questions to guide your post-session review:

- **Engagement**: Did participation drop at any point? What was happening in the session at that time?
- **Polls**: Were there questions where many students answered incorrectly? Do you need to revisit that topic?
- **Chat**: Were there unanswered questions in the chat?
- **Breakout rooms**: Did all groups use their full time, or did some finish early?
- **Pacing**: Was the session too long, too short, or well-timed?

<Tip>Review your session data within 24 hours while the experience is fresh. Note 2–3 specific changes you'll make for next time.</Tip>
