BigBlueButton includes built-in timer and stopwatch tools to help you manage time during your session.

## Timer (Countdown)

Use the countdown timer to set time limits for activities:

- Set a duration (e.g., 5 minutes for a breakout room discussion)
- The timer is visible to all participants
- An alert sounds when time is up
- Great for timed activities, quizzes, or transition warnings

## Stopwatch (Count Up)

Use the stopwatch to track elapsed time:

- Start the stopwatch at the beginning of an activity
- Visible to all participants
- Useful for open-ended activities where you want to monitor how long things take
