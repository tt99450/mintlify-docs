BigBlueButton uses three roles to manage permissions and responsibilities during a session.

## Role Overview

| Role | Can present? | Can manage users? | Can record? | Assigned how? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Moderator** | Yes (when presenter) | Yes | Yes | Set when joining or by room config |
| **Presenter** | Yes | No | No | Assigned by moderator |
| **Viewer** | No | No | No | Default role for participants |

<Note>A session can have **multiple moderators** but only **one active presenter** at a time.</Note>

## Assign the Presenter Role

Transfer the presenter role to allow another user to control slides, share their screen, or run polls:

- Click on a user in the user list and select **Make presenter**
- The current presenter automatically becomes a viewer
- You can take back the presenter role at any time

See [Give/Take Presenter Role](/help/moderator-guide/givetake-presenter-role) for details.

## Promote and Demote Users

Moderators can change a user's role during the session:

- **Promote a viewer to moderator** — gives them user management capabilities
- **Demote a moderator to viewer** — removes management permissions
- **Remove a user** — eject them from the session entirely

See [Promote/Demote/Remove a User](/help/moderator-guide/promotedemoteremove-a-user) for step-by-step instructions.

## Co-Teaching Setup

For sessions with multiple instructors:

1. Have both instructors join as **moderators**
2. Assign the **presenter** role to whoever is actively teaching
3. Swap the presenter role as needed throughout the session
4. Both moderators retain the ability to manage users, breakout rooms, and recording regardless of who is presenting

<Tip>Coordinate with your co-teacher beforehand about when you'll swap presenter roles to keep transitions smooth.</Tip>
