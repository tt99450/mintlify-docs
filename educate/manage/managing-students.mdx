As a moderator, you have tools to manage participant behavior and maintain a productive learning environment.

## User Management Panel

Access user management by clicking on any user in the user list. From there you can:

- **Mute/unmute** individual participants
- **Mute all** — silence all participants at once
- **Remove** a user from the session
- **Promote** a viewer to moderator or **demote** a moderator to viewer

See [Manage Users](/help/moderator-guide/manage-users) for the complete guide.

## Lock Settings

Restrict specific capabilities for all viewers in the session:

- Disable microphone, webcam, public chat, private chat, or shared notes
- Lock settings apply to all viewers (moderators are not affected)
- Settings can be changed during the session

See [Lock Viewers' Abilities](/help/moderator-guide/lock-viewers-ability-to-use-their-micwebcamchatshared-notes).

## Private Chat Controls

Control whether viewers can send private messages to each other:

- Lock or unlock private chat for individual users or all viewers
- Useful for preventing off-topic side conversations during instruction

See [Lock/Unlock Private Chat](/help/moderator-guide/how-to-lock-or-unlock-users-to-enable-or-disable-private-chat-messages).

## Raise Hand Queue

Students can raise their hand to signal a question or comment:

- Raised hands appear as indicators next to the user's name
- Address raised hands in order to keep discussion fair
- Students lower their hand after being acknowledged, or moderators can lower it for them

See [Raise Hand](/help/user-guide/raise-hand).

## Clearing the Chat

If the public chat becomes cluttered or off-topic:

- Moderators can clear the entire public chat history
- This removes all messages for all participants
- Use sparingly — consider a verbal reminder first

See [Clear the Public Chat](/help/moderator-guide/clear-the-public-chat).

## Tips for Classroom Management

<Tip>
- Start sessions with **microphones muted** and unlock as needed
- Use **lock settings** proactively for large classes (50+ students)
- Keep an eye on the **raise hand queue** — a forgotten raised hand frustrates students
- Use **private chat** to address individual behavior without disrupting the class
