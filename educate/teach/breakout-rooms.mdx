Breakout rooms split participants into smaller groups for focused discussion, collaboration, or activities.

## Full Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create breakout rooms">
    As a moderator, open the breakout room panel and configure:
    - **Number of rooms** — how many groups to create
    - **Duration** — time limit for the breakout session
    - **Assignment** — randomly assign, let users choose, or manually assign participants

    See [Create and Manage Breakout Rooms](/help/moderator-guide/create-and-manage-breakout-rooms).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign participants">
    Drag and drop users between rooms or use automatic assignment. You can also allow students to choose their own room.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start breakout rooms">
    Click **Start** to open all rooms simultaneously. Participants receive a notification to join their assigned room.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor progress">
    As a moderator, you can:
    - See which users are in which rooms
    - Join any breakout room to observe or participate
    - Send a message to all rooms
    - Extend the time if needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bring everyone back">
    When time expires (or you end breakout rooms early), all participants return to the main room automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Joining Breakout Rooms (Participant View)

Participants receive a notification when breakout rooms open and can join their assigned room. See [Join Breakout Rooms](/help/user-guide/join-breakout-rooms).

## Inviting Moderators to Breakout Rooms

You can invite other moderators to specific breakout rooms for co-facilitation. See [Invite Moderators to Breakout Rooms](/help/releases/invite-moderators-to-breakout-rooms).

## 1:1 Breakout Rooms

Create a breakout room with just two people for:

- Individual student conferences
- Private conversations
- One-on-one tutoring or feedback

Simply create a breakout room and assign only two participants (or join the room yourself with one student).

## Exporting Breakout Room Artifacts

Capture work from breakout rooms before they close:

- **Export shared notes** — save collaborative text from each room. See [Export Breakout Room Shared Notes](/help/releases/how-to-export-a-breakout-rooms-shared-notes).
- **Export whiteboard annotations** — save drawings and annotations from each room. See [Export Breakout Room Whiteboard Annotations](/help/releases/how-to-export-a-breakout-rooms-whiteboard-annotations).

<Warning>Breakout room content (shared notes, whiteboard annotations) is lost when rooms close unless you export it first.</Warning>

## Tips

- **Set clear instructions** before opening breakout rooms — students should know their task
- **Use the timer** to keep groups on track
- **Visit rooms briefly** to check progress without disrupting
- **Allow 1–2 minutes** for transition time when planning your session timeline
