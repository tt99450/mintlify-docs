BigBlueButton gives you multiple ways to deliver content to your class.

## Presentation Controls

Navigate and annotate your uploaded slides during the session:

- Use arrow keys or toolbar buttons to navigate slides
- Zoom in on specific areas
- Use built-in annotation tools (pen, shapes, text) to highlight content
- Pointer tool to guide attention

See [Use the Presentation Controls](/help/presenter-guide/use-the-presentation-controls).

## Screen Sharing

Share your entire screen or a specific application window:

- Share your desktop for live software demos
- Share a specific window to keep other content private
- Works with all major browsers (Chrome recommended)

See [Share My Screen](/help/presenter-guide/share-my-screen).

<Tip>Close unnecessary tabs and notifications before sharing your screen to avoid distractions.</Tip>

## External Video

Share a YouTube video or other external media link with synchronized playback:

- Paste a video URL and it plays for all participants simultaneously
- Playback controls are synchronized — when you pause, everyone pauses
- Great for supplementary video content or guest lectures

See [Share an External Audio/Video Link](/help/presenter-guide/share-an-external-audiovideo-link).

## Camera as Content

Use your webcam as a document camera or content source:

- Position your webcam to show physical documents, whiteboards, or objects
- The camera feed appears in the presentation area (not the webcam area)
- Useful for showing handwritten work, lab equipment, or physical materials

See [Camera as Content](/help/releases/camera-as-content).

## Downloading the Original Presentation

Participants can download the original uploaded presentation file if the presenter enables this option:

See [Download of Original Presentation](/help/releases/download-of-original-presentation).
