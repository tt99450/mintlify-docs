Facilitating discussion in a virtual classroom requires active management of multiple communication channels.

## Microphone Management

Control who speaks and when:

- **Mute all** — silence all participants before starting a discussion
- **Unmute selectively** — call on students by unmuting them or asking them to unmute
- **Lock microphones** — prevent viewers from unmuting themselves (useful for large classes)

See [Manage Users](/help/moderator-guide/manage-users) for microphone controls.

## Raise Hand Queue

The raise hand feature creates an orderly discussion flow:

- Students click **Raise Hand** to signal they want to speak
- Raised hands appear in the user list in the order they were raised
- Call on students in order to keep things fair
- Ask students to lower their hand after speaking

See [Raise Hand](/help/user-guide/raise-hand).

<Tip>In large classes, announce "raise your hand if you want to respond" before opening discussion. This prevents everyone from unmuting at once.</Tip>

## Chat Monitoring

Use public chat as a parallel discussion channel:

- Monitor for questions while presenting
- Encourage students to post questions in chat during lectures
- Pause periodically to address chat questions verbally
- Use chat for quick informal polls ("type yes/no in chat")

See [Send Public and Private Chat Messages](/help/user-guide/send-public-and-private-chat-messages).

### Clearing Chat

If the chat becomes too noisy or off-topic, moderators can clear the public chat:

See [Clear the Public Chat](/help/moderator-guide/clear-the-public-chat).

## Discussion Strategies

| Strategy | How | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Think-Pair-Share | Breakout rooms → return to main room | Deep discussion |
| Rapid Response | Type answers in public chat | Quick checks |
| Moderated Q&A | Raise hand → unmute → speak | Formal discussions |
| Backchannel | Chat alongside lecture | Continuous engagement |
| Anonymous Input | Polls or shared notes | Sensitive topics |
