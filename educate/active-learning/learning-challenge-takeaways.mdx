End your session with purpose — use challenges to reinforce learning and export artifacts for future reference.

## Learning Challenges

Turn end-of-session activities into engaging challenges:

### Timed Quiz Challenge
- Use the **timer** to add urgency to a final quiz
- Launch a poll with questions covering the session's key concepts
- Display results and celebrate top performers
- See [Timer and Stopwatch](/help/releases/timer-and-stopwatch) and [Use Polling/Quizzing](/help/presenter-guide/use-pollingquzzing)

### Whiteboard Challenge
- Give students 2 minutes to draw or diagram a key concept from memory
- Use the **per-user whiteboard** so each student works independently
- Review select responses as a class
- See [Per-User Whiteboard](/help/moderator-guide/how-do-i-use-the-per-user-whiteboard)

## Key Takeaways

Capture what students learned before the session ends:

### Exit Ticket (Poll)
- Launch a custom response poll: "What is the most important thing you learned today?"
- Review responses to gauge understanding

### Shared Notes Summary
- Ask students to add their key takeaway to shared notes
- Export the notes for class reference
- See [Use Shared Notes](/help/user-guide/use-shared-notes)

## Exporting Session Artifacts
