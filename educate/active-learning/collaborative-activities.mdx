BigBlueButton's collaborative tools let students work together in real time, creating a more engaging learning experience.

## Multi-User Whiteboard

Enable the multi-user whiteboard so all participants can draw and annotate simultaneously:

- **Brainstorming** — students add ideas visually on the whiteboard
- **Collaborative diagramming** — build diagrams together as a class
- **Group annotation** — annotate images, maps, or charts together
- **Problem solving** — work through math or science problems collaboratively

See [Multi-User Whiteboard](/help/releases/how-do-i-use-the-multi-user-whiteboard) and [Use the Multi-User Whiteboard](/help/user-guide/use-the-multi-user-whiteboard).

## Per-User Whiteboard

Give each student their own whiteboard layer for individual work:

- Students work independently on the same slide
- Moderators can view each student's work privately
- Great for individual practice, quizzes, or assessments
- Students can't see each other's work

See [Per-User Whiteboard](/help/moderator-guide/how-do-i-use-the-per-user-whiteboard).

## Shared Notes Integration

Combine shared notes with the whiteboard for multi-format collaboration:

- **Move shared notes to the whiteboard** — transfer text content for group review and annotation. See [Move Shared Notes to the Whiteboard](/help/releases/how-do-i-move-shared-notes-to-the-whiteboard).
- **Export shared notes** — save collaborative text for later use
