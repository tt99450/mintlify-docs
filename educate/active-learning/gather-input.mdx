Gathering input from students keeps them engaged and gives you insight into their thinking.

## Custom Response Polls

Use polls with typed responses to collect open-ended input:

- Students type their own answers instead of choosing from options
- Great for brainstorming, word association, or collecting examples
- All responses are visible to the presenter

See [Use Polling/Quizzing](/help/presenter-guide/use-pollingquzzing).

## Responding to Polls (Student View)

Students see a poll notification and can respond directly:

- Click to select an option (multiple choice) or type a response (custom)
- Responses are submitted anonymously by default
- Results appear when the presenter publishes them

See [Respond to Polls](/help/user-guide/respond-to-polls).

## Shared Notes for Input

Use shared notes as a collaborative input tool:

- Pose a question and have students type responses in shared notes
- Everyone can see and build on each other's ideas
- Great for collaborative brainstorming or collecting questions

See [Use Shared Notes](/help/user-guide/use-shared-notes).

## Input Gathering Strategies

| Strategy | Tool | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Quick brainstorm | Custom poll | "Type one word that describes..." |
| Collaborative list | Shared notes | "Add your ideas to the shared notes" |
| Anonymous feedback | Custom poll | "What's still unclear?" |
| Group discussion prep | Shared notes | "Write your question before breakout rooms" |
| Think-pair-share | Shared notes + breakout rooms | Individual → small group → class |
