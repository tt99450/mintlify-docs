Real-time comprehension checks help you identify gaps and adjust your teaching on the fly.

## Quick Polls

Launch instant polls to gauge understanding:

- **Yes/No** — quick binary checks ("Do you understand this concept?")
- **True/False** — fact verification
- **A/B/C/D** — multiple choice questions
- **Custom responses** — open-ended typed answers

See [Use Polling/Quizzing](/help/presenter-guide/use-pollingquzzing) for poll creation and management.

## Smart Slides

Design poll questions directly into your presentation slides:

- Format questions with answer options on your slides (e.g., "A) Option 1 / B) Option 2")
- BigBlueButton automatically detects poll-formatted slides
- One click launches the poll — no manual configuration needed
- Results display immediately on screen

See [Using Smart Slides for One-Click Polling](/help/moderator-guide/using-smart-slides-for-one-click-polling).

<Tip>Prepare Smart Slides in advance for a seamless polling experience during your session. See [Create Engaging Content](/prepare/create-engaging-content).</Tip>

## Quiz Mode

Use polling as a graded quiz:

- Questions with correct answers marked
- Results show which students got the right answer
- Review results as a class for learning moments

## Visual Assessment

Poll results display as a chart visible to all participants:

- See the distribution of answers at a glance
- Use results to guide your next explanation
- Share results to spark discussion ("Why did some people choose B?")
