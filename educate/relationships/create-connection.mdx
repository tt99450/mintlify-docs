Building connections in a virtual classroom requires intentional use of communication tools. BigBlueButton offers several ways for participants to interact beyond audio.

## Public and Private Chat

Chat is often the most active communication channel in a virtual classroom:

- **Public chat** — visible to everyone; great for questions, responses, and shared links
- **Private chat** — one-on-one messages between any two participants; useful for individual support or quiet side conversations

See [Send Public and Private Chat Messages](/help/user-guide/send-public-and-private-chat-messages).

<Tip>
  Encourage students to use public chat for questions during a lecture. This lets quieter students participate without unmuting.

## Reactions

The reactions bar lets participants send quick, visual feedback without interrupting the speaker:

- Emoji reactions appear briefly next to the user's name
- Use reactions for informal polls ("thumbs up if you understand")
- Reactions lower the barrier to participation

See [Reactions Bar](/help/releases/reactions-bar).

## Status Indicators

Participants can set a status emoji to communicate their state:

- **Raise hand** — signal a question or comment
- **Away** — indicate you've stepped away
- Custom **status emojis **for mood or feedback

See [Set a Status](/help/user-guide/set-a-status).

## Tips for Building Connection

- **Start with an icebreaker** — use public chat or reactions for a quick warm-up
- **Acknowledge participation** — call out good questions and reactions by name
- **Use private chat for support** — check in with quiet students individually
- **Model the behavior** — use reactions and chat yourself to normalize participation
