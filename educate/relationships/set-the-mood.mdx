Small environmental adjustments can make a virtual classroom feel more welcoming and reduce fatigue.

## Dark Mode

Switch to dark mode to reduce eye strain, especially for evening sessions or long classes:

- Reduces screen brightness and glare
- Can help reduce video call fatigue
- Each participant can enable it individually

See [Enable Dark Mode](/help/releases/how-do-i-enable-dark-mode).

## Reactions for Comfort

Use the reactions bar to create a relaxed, participatory atmosphere:

- Encourage students to use reactions freely during warm-ups
- Reactions provide a low-pressure way to participate
- Seeing emoji reactions from peers makes the session feel more human and connected

See [Reactions Bar](/help/releases/reactions-bar).

## Webcam Backgrounds

Let participants customize their appearance to feel more comfortable on camera:

- Blur backgrounds for privacy
- Use virtual backgrounds to reduce distractions

See [Change Webcam Background](/help/releases/how-do-i-change-my-webcams-background).
