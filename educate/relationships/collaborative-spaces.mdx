BigBlueButton provides two primary tools for real-time collaboration: the multi-user whiteboard and shared notes.

## Multi-User Whiteboard

Enable the multi-user whiteboard to let all participants draw, annotate, and contribute visually:

- All participants can draw simultaneously on the presentation slides
- Use for brainstorming, diagramming, or collaborative problem-solving
- The presenter can clear annotations or disable multi-user mode at any time

See [Use the Multi-User Whiteboard](/help/user-guide/use-the-multi-user-whiteboard).

### Per-User Whiteboard

For individual work that the moderator can review:

- Each student gets their own whiteboard layer
- Moderators can view each student's work individually
- Great for assessments or individual exercises

See [Per-User Whiteboard](/help/moderator-guide/how-do-i-use-the-per-user-whiteboard).

## Shared Notes

Shared notes provide a collaborative text editor that all participants can edit simultaneously:

- Real-time collaborative editing (like Google Docs)
- Use for meeting minutes, group brainstorming, or collecting responses
- Content can be exported or moved to the whiteboard

See [Use Shared Notes](/help/user-guide/use-shared-notes).

### Move Shared Notes to the Whiteboard

Transfer shared notes content to the whiteboard for group review and annotation:

See [Move Shared Notes to the Whiteboard](/help/releases/how-do-i-move-shared-notes-to-the-whiteboard).
