The Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD) gives moderators real-time insight into student engagement during a session.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Open the Learning Analytics Dashboard from the moderator panel during a live session. The dashboard updates in real time as students participate.

See [Learning Analytics Dashboard](/help/moderator-guide/learning-analytics-dashboard) for setup and usage details.

## Engagement Metrics

The dashboard tracks several engagement indicators:

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| **Activity Score** | Overall engagement level per student |
| **Talk Time** | How long each student has spoken |
| **Webcam Time** | How long each student has shared their camera |
| **Messages Sent** | Number of chat messages per student |
| **Emojis/Reactions** | Reactions and status changes |
| **Raise Hand** | Number of times a student raised their hand |
| **Poll Responses** | Whether and how students responded to polls |

## Timeline View

The timeline view shows engagement patterns across the session:

- See when students were most and least active
- Identify drops in engagement that may correlate with specific content
- Use this data to adjust pacing and activity frequency

## Poll and Quiz Results

Review poll and quiz results within the dashboard:

- See per-student responses
- Identify common misconceptions from wrong answers
- Export results for grading or follow-up

## Using Analytics to Improve Teaching

<Tip>
- Check the dashboard **during** the session to spot disengaged students early
- Review the dashboard **after** the session to identify patterns
- Compare engagement across sessions to see what activities work best
- Use the data to plan more engaging activities for next time
