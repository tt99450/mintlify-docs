## Create Your Room

You can create a BigBlueButton room through two paths:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Personal Rooms" icon="door-open" href="/help/personal-rooms/how-do-i-create-my-own-rooms">
    Create standalone rooms with custom names and settings — no LMS required.
  </Card>
  <Card title="LMS Integration" icon="plug" href="/integrations/overview">
    Set up BigBlueButton conferences through Canvas, Moodle, or Sakai.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Configure Room Settings

### Lock Settings

Control what viewers can do during the session. Lock settings let you restrict:

- Microphone usage
- Webcam sharing
- Public and private chat
- Shared notes access

Configure these before the session starts so the room is ready. See [Lock Viewers' Abilities](/help/moderator-guide/lock-viewers-ability-to-use-their-micwebcamchatshared-notes).

### Guest Policy

Control who can enter your room:

- **Always accept** — anyone with the link can join
- **Always deny** — no guests allowed
- **Ask moderator** — moderator approves each guest

See [Configure Guest Policy](/help/moderator-guide/how-to-configure-guest-policy).

## Invite Participants

Once your room is configured, share the join link with your participants:

- **Personal rooms** — copy the room link and share via email or LMS. See [Invite Attendees](/help/personal-rooms/can-i-invite-attendees-to-my-meetings).
- **LMS conferences** — students access the session directly from your course page.
