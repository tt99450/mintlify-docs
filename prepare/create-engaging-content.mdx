Prepare your content ahead of time so you can focus on teaching during the session.

## Upload Presentations

BigBlueButton supports PDF and office document uploads. Upload your slides before or during the session:

- Supported formats: **PDF** (recommended), PowerPoint, Word, and other office documents
- PDFs render most reliably — convert your slides to PDF for best results
- You can upload multiple presentations and switch between them during the session
- Optionally enable presentation download for participants

See [Upload a Presentation](/help/presenter-guide/upload-a-presentation-enable-for-download) for step-by-step instructions.

<Tip>Upload your presentation **before** the session starts. This saves class time and lets you verify that all slides render correctly.</Tip>

## Smart Slides for One-Click Polling

Design your slides with built-in poll questions that BigBlueButton automatically detects:

- Add poll-formatted text to your slides (e.g., "A) Option 1 / B) Option 2")
- BigBlueButton recognizes the format and creates a one-click poll button
- No need to manually configure polls during class — just click to launch

See [Using Smart Slides for One-Click Polling](/help/moderator-guide/using-smart-slides-for-one-click-polling) for formatting guidelines and examples.
