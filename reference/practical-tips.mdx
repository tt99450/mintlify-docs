Quick tips organized by area to help you get the most out of BigBlueButton.

## Audio

- **Use a headset** to avoid echo and feedback
- **Mute when not speaking** — especially in large sessions
- **Test audio before class** using the echo test
- **Close other audio apps** (Spotify, etc.) to avoid interference
- Join via **microphone** (not listen-only) if you plan to speak

## Chat

- **Save important chat messages** before the session ends — chat is not preserved after the meeting
- Use **private chat** for individual student support without disrupting the class
- **Pin important messages** by referencing them verbally so students can scroll back
- Moderators can **clear public chat** if it becomes too noisy

## Webcams

- **Good lighting** matters more than camera quality — face a window or desk lamp
- **Blur your background** for privacy. See [Change Webcam Background](/help/releases/how-do-i-change-my-webcams-background)
- **Disable self-view** if your own video is distracting. See [Disable Self-View](/help/releases/disable-self-view-of-webcam)
- **Pin important webcams** to keep them visible. See [Pin a Webcam](/help/releases/how-do-i-pin-a-webcam)
- **Adjust brightness** if your webcam image is too dark. See [Adjust Brightness](/help/releases/how-do-i-adjust-my-webcams-brightness)

## Presentations

- **Convert to PDF** before uploading for the most reliable rendering
- **Use large fonts** (24pt+) — small text is hard to read on student screens
- **Upload before class** to save time and verify rendering
- **Enable download** if students need the slides for reference. See [Download Original Presentation](/help/releases/download-of-original-presentation)

## Whiteboard

- **Use different colors** when multiple people annotate to tell contributions apart
- **Clear annotations** between slides to avoid clutter
- The **multi-user whiteboard** is great for collaborative work but can get chaotic — set clear instructions
- **Export whiteboard annotations** from breakout rooms before closing them

## Screen Sharing

- **Close unnecessary tabs** and notifications before sharing
- **Share a specific window** instead of your entire screen to maintain privacy
- **Use Chrome or Edge** for the best screen sharing experience
- Sharing **iPad/iPhone screens** requires AirPlay or QuickTime mirroring. See [Share iPad Screen](/help/faq/how-to-share-ipadiphone-screen-using-screen-share-in-bigbluebutton)

## Breakout Rooms

- **Give clear instructions** before opening breakout rooms
- **Set a timer** so groups know how much time they have
- **Visit rooms briefly** to check progress
- **Export shared notes and whiteboard** before closing rooms
- Allow **1–2 minutes** for transition time in your session plan
